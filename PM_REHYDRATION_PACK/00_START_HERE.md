# PM Self Rehydration — Start Here (Meta)

Last updated: 2025-12-29 (Wave F13)

This pack keeps the ChatGPT PM (this window) aligned while we build the **repo OS**:
- file/folder structure
- documentation library + indexes
- policies/templates that will later govern Cursor + PM behavior

It exists to prevent drift across many waves.

## Read order (fast)
1. `LAST_UPDATED.md`
2. `03_PROGRESS_LOG.md`
3. `02_DECISIONS.md`
4. `05_NEXT_ACTIONS.md`
5. `04_OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`

Authoritative references:
- `REHYDRATION_PACK/` (operational pack attached every cycle)
- `REHYDRATION_PACK/WAVE_SCHEDULE_FULL.md` (master schedule)
- `docs/98_Agent_Ops/` (policies, templates, standards)

## Non-negotiables (meta-work)
- The structure must be AI-first: index-first navigation, low token cost, no orphan files.
- Every wave must update this meta pack and keep it consistent with `REHYDRATION_PACK/`.
- Prefer small, verifiable changes per wave.
