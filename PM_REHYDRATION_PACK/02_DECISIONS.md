# Meta Decisions (Repo / Documentation OS)

Last updated: 2025-12-29 (Wave F13)

These decisions govern how we run the project using AI agents.

---

## Confirmed by user (locked)

- We use **ChatGPT (PM)** + **3 Cursor agents** (Agent A, Agent B, Agent C)
- Agents do the work; manual effort is minimized (human does copy/paste + zip transfers only)
- Agents **update docs directly every run** (living docs must stay current)
- Agents may refactor with guardrails (no silent contract breaks)
- Secrets manager: **AWS Secrets Manager**

---

## Recommended defaults adopted (locked unless changed later)

- Runtime architecture (v1): AWS serverless
  - API Gateway + Lambda + SQS FIFO + DynamoDB (idempotency/state)
- IaC tool of record (v1): AWS CDK (TypeScript)
- Backend language (Lambda runtime): Python 3.11
- Frontend: include placeholder planning now; implement later (Next.js TypeScript)

---

## Documentation OS decisions

- **Mode separation:** `foundation` vs `build` is controlled by `REHYDRATION_PACK/MODE.yaml`
- **Rehydration pack manifest:** `REHYDRATION_PACK/MANIFEST.yaml` is authoritative; validated by `scripts/verify_rehydration_pack.py`
- **Docs indexing:** registries are generated by `scripts/regen_doc_registry.py`
- **Reference indexing:** registries are generated by `scripts/regen_reference_registry.py`
- **Living Documentation Set:** must be continuously updated during build
  - `docs/98_Agent_Ops/Living_Documentation_Set.md`
- **Plan → checklist extraction:** compiled outputs generated by `scripts/regen_plan_checklist.py`
- **Legacy redirects:** redirect folders must only contain MOVED stubs (no duplicate canonical content)
  - `docs/00_Project_Admin/Legacy_Folder_Redirects.md`

## 2025-12-29 — Wave naming clarified
- Adopted F/B/C wave naming; B00 is the build kickoff wave (mode transition + CI baseline).
- Added canonical mapping doc: `docs/00_Project_Admin/Wave_Naming_and_Mapping.md`.

- 2025-12-29: Clarified that B00 is build kickoff only; not required for documentation OS completion.



## GitHub workflow defaults (recommended)
- Default execution: sequential (single run branch)
- Parallel allowed only with disjoint scopes and integrator
- Branch prefixes allowed: run/, hotfix/, release/
- No run complete until main updated and CI green

## Wave F13 decisions
- Auto-close policy updated from "never" to "whitelisted only" (reply-to-reopen required). Initial whitelist: `t_order_eta_no_tracking_verified`.
- Order status when no tracking exists yet: send SLA-based remaining business-day window by shipping bucket.
