-# Branch Protection and Merge Settings
-
-Last verified: 2025-12-29 — Wave B00 (Build kickoff + Cursor agent takeover).
-Status: Canonical
-
-This document defines the **required GitHub repository settings** that make this project safe to run with:
-- ChatGPT as PM
-- 3 Cursor agents (A/B/C)
-
-These settings prevent:
-- stale `main`
-- accidental destructive changes to critical docs/structure
-- merge conflicts and branch explosion
-- bypassing CI
-
-Related:
-- `docs/98_Agent_Ops/Policies/POL-GH-001__GitHub_and_Repo_Operations_Policy.md`
-- `docs/08_Engineering/Multi_Agent_GitOps_Playbook.md`
-- `docs/08_Engineering/CI_and_Actions_Runbook.md`
-
----
-
-## 1) Required repo settings (Settings → General → Pull Requests)
-
-### Merge methods
-**Required (current state)**
-- ✅ **Allow merge commits** — the only enabled merge strategy
-- ⛔ **Squash merging** — disabled
-- ⛔ **Rebase merging** — disabled
-
-Rationale:
-- Merge commits keep a clear audit trail per `RUN_ID`.
-
-### Auto-delete branches
-**Required**
-- ✅ **Automatically delete head branches**
-
-Rationale:
-- Prevents “branch explosion” (50–100 remote branches).
-
----
-
-## 2) Required branch protection rule for `main`
-
-Path: **Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules → Add rule**
-
-### Rule target
-- Branch name pattern: `main`
-
-> Source of truth for the rule snapshot: `branch_protection_main.json`
-
-### Pull request requirement
-**Required (current state)**
-- ✅ Require a pull request before merging
-- ✅ Require approvals: **0** (automation-friendly; CI + conversation resolution act as the guardrails)
-- ✅ Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
-- ✅ Require conversation resolution before merging
-
-### Status checks
-**Required**
-- ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
-- ✅ Required checks must include the repo CI workflow/job
-
-This repo’s baseline workflow + job:
-- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` → workflow name: `CI`, job: **`validate`** (strict/up-to-date = **true**)
-
-Important:
-- GitHub only lets you select required checks after the workflow has run at least once.
-- Create a small PR to trigger CI, then return here and select the check(s) from the list.
-
-Recommended
-- ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
-
-### Admin / destructive controls
-**Required**
-- ✅ Include administrators
-- ⛔ Allow force pushes: **OFF**
-- ⛔ Allow deletions: **OFF**
-
-Rationale:
-- Agents must not be able to bypass the same safety gates as humans.
-
----
-
-## 3) Verification checklist (do once)
-
-1) Create a PR from a run branch (example): `run/RUN_20251229_2315Z` → `main`
-2) Confirm the PR cannot merge until:
-   - `CI / validate` (or the equivalent check name in your repo) is green
-   - approvals are present
-3) Merge using **merge commit**
-4) Confirm the head branch was auto-deleted
-
----
-
-## 4) Optional automation (advanced)
-
-If your token has **admin** permissions, you can set protection via API.
-This is optional; the safest path is to configure in the GitHub UI.
-
-Example (outline only):
-- Use `gh api` with `repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/main/protection`
-- Apply:
-  - required status checks
-  - required PR reviews
-  - force push + deletion disabled
-
-If you automate this, record:
-- the exact command(s)
-- the resulting configuration
-in `docs/00_Project_Admin/Decision_Log.md`.
+# Branch Protection and Merge Settings
+
+Last verified: 2026-01-15 — Updated for risk-based gated checks (Bugbot + Codecov + Claude).
+Status: Canonical
+
+This document defines the **required GitHub repository settings** that make this project safe to run with:
+- ChatGPT as PM
+- 3 Cursor agents (A/B/C)
+
+These settings prevent:
+- stale `main`
+- accidental destructive changes to critical docs/structure
+- merge conflicts and branch explosion
+- bypassing CI
+- merging without risk-appropriate semantic/coverage gates
+
+Related:
