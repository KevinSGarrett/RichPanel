+# RichPanel Claude Review Guide
+
+This repository uses **Claude Code GitHub Actions** to perform gated, automated PR reviews (semantic + security + correctness).
+
+## Primary objective
+
+When asked to `/review` a PR, you must **audit the diff** and identify:
+
+1. **Correctness / regressions** (logic errors, incorrect edge cases, missing handling)
+2. **Security** (authz/authn, injection, SSRF, deserialization, unsafe defaults)
+3. **PII / sensitive data** handling (logging, telemetry, storage, redaction)
+4. **Reliability** (retries, idempotency, failure modes, timeouts)
+5. **Infra/CDK safety** (least privilege IAM, breaking changes, migration steps)
+6. **Test adequacy** (what tests exist, what is missing, where to add)
+
+## Hard requirements to enforce
+
+- **Do not recommend logging secrets or PII**.
+- **Fail closed** for security and privacy: if unsure, call it out as a blocking issue.
+- Prefer **idempotent handlers** and safe retries for worker/pipeline code.
+- Ensure changes keep **CI contract** green:
+  - `python scripts/run_ci_checks.py --ci` must pass.
+
+## Review style
+
+- Be **specific**: include file paths, symbols, and suggested edits.
+- Separate issues into:
+  - **Blocking** (must-fix before merge)
+  - **Non-blocking** (nice-to-have)
+- If you are uncertain, state the assumption and ask for clarification, but **still propose a safe default**.
+
+## Output format
+
+Use this structure:
+
+1) **Summary** (2–5 bullets)
+2) **Blocking issues** (numbered list)
+3) **Non-blocking improvements**
+4) **Test plan suggestions**
+5) **Risk notes** (what could go wrong in prod)
