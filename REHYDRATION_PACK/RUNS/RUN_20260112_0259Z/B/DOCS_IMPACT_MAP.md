**Run ID:** `RUN_20260112_0259Z`  
**Agent:** B (Engineering)  
**Date:** 2026-01-12

Goal: document what changed and where documentation must be updated.

## Docs updated in this run
- `docs/08_Engineering/CI_and_Actions_Runbook.md` — Added CLI Richpanel proof workflow section with command patterns and evidence expectations

## Docs that should be updated next (if any)
- None required; proof workflow is now documented

## Index/registry updates
- `docs/INDEX.md` updated: no
- `docs/CODEMAP.md` updated: no
- `docs/_generated/*` regenerated: yes (doc_registry.json, doc_registry.compact.json)
- `reference/_generated/*` regenerated: no (no reference changes)

## Notes
The CLI proof workflow documentation was added to CI_and_Actions_Runbook.md to standardize how dev E2E smoke proof is captured and stored in run artifacts.
