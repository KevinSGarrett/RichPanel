# Structure Report

**Run ID:** `RUN_20260112_0259Z`  
**Agent:** A  
**Date:** 2026-01-12

## Changes to file/folder structure
- **New file created:** `REHYDRATION_PACK/_TEMPLATES/Run_Report_TEMPLATE.md`
- **New run folder created:** `REHYDRATION_PACK/RUNS/RUN_20260112_0259Z/` (with A/B/C subdirs)

## Files modified (structure impact)
- `REHYDRATION_PACK/_TEMPLATES/Cursor_Agent_Prompt_TEMPLATE.md`: Added new "PR Health Check" section (lines 148-172)
- `docs/08_Engineering/CI_and_Actions_Runbook.md`: Added new Section 4; renumbered sections 4→5, 5→6, 6→7, 7→8, 8→9, 9→10, 10→11, 11→12, 12→13

## Naming conventions followed
- Run folder: `RUN_<YYYYMMDD>_<HHMMZ>` (timestamp-based, generated by `scripts/new_run_folder.py`)
- Template file: `Run_Report_TEMPLATE.md` (matches pattern of other templates in `_TEMPLATES/`)
- Checklist ID: `CHK-009B` (follows sequential pattern, B suffix indicates sub-item of CHK-009)
- Task ID: `TASK-252` (follows sequential numbering)

## Impact on navigation/indexing
- Doc registries auto-regenerated: `docs/_generated/doc_registry.json`, `doc_registry.compact.json`, `doc_outline.json`, `heading_index.json`
- New template file will be picked up by future template validation if such a check is added
- Runbook section renumbering (4→5, etc.) requires attention when referencing sections by number in external docs (none found)

## Compliance with repo conventions
- ✅ Run folder created using canonical script (`scripts/new_run_folder.py --now`)
- ✅ Template stored in `REHYDRATION_PACK/_TEMPLATES/` (canonical location)
- ✅ Progress_Log updated with run entry (anti-drift gate requirement)
- ✅ TASK_BOARD and MASTER_CHECKLIST updated (PM alignment requirement)
- ✅ Doc registries regenerated (CI requirement)
- ✅ All files use `.md` extension and UTF-8 encoding
- ✅ No binary files or secrets added

## References / links impacted
- Internal cross-references in runbook (section numbers) are self-contained; no external docs link to specific section numbers
- Template references in prompt templates now include new `Run_Report_TEMPLATE.md` implicitly (agents fill out RUN_REPORT.md based on structure)
