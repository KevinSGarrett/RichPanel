# Notes

- run_ci_checks.py --ci fails locally because regenerated doc registry outputs differ from HEAD (expected after new doc).
- REHYDRATION_PACK warnings include nonstandard run folder names (B51, legacy B42/B46).
- CI validate passed; Codecov patch coverage failing (83.23% < 85.54%).
- Claude gate comment captured response/request IDs and token usage.
- No secrets printed in command outputs.
