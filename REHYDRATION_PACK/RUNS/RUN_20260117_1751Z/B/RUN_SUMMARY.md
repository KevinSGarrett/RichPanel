# Run Summary — RUN_20260117_1751Z (Agent B)

**Status:** Agent B idle (no work in this run)

**Mission:** Agent A (B40) — Order Status Ops + Docs

**Agent B scope:** None (Agent A docs-only run)

## TL;DR

Agent B had no deliverables in this run. This was an Agent A focused run to create operational documentation for Order Status deployment readiness:
- Production Read-Only Shadow Mode Runbook
- Order Status E2E Proof requirements
- Deployment Readiness Checklist (CHK-012A)

## Reference

See `../A/RUN_SUMMARY.md` for full run summary and deliverables.
