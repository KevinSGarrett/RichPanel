  - Comment: https://github.com/KevinSGarrett/RichPanel/pull/136#issuecomment-3781073138
  - Workflow wrote comment body to `.claude_gate_comment.txt` on runner; enforcement step now fails if skip!=false or response_id/model is empty.
- Workflow/process notes:
  - `pr_risk_label_required.yml` now fails when `gate:claude` is missing (while keeping exactly-one risk label rule).
  - `pr_claude_gate_required.yml` drops continue-on-error and enforces skip=false + response_id/model output to prevent silent passes.
  - PR template and Cursor agent prompts now require `REHYDRATION_PACK/PR_DESCRIPTION/` compliance, risk+gate labels, and self-score gates; added short agent prompt template.
- Bugbot: check run completed (neutral) with summary "1 potential issue" — see Cursor check run https://github.com/KevinSGarrett/RichPanel/runs/61069847337
- Codecov: pass (patch) for PR #136.
