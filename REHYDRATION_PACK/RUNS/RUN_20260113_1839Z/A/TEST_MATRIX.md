# Test Matrix

**Run ID:** `RUN_20260113_1839Z`  
**Agent:** A  
**Date:** 2026-01-13

List the tests you ran (or explicitly note none).

| Test name | Command / method | Pass/Fail | Evidence path/link |
|---|---|---|---|
| CI equivalent (planned) | `python scripts/run_ci_checks.py --ci` | Pending rerun (must pass) | Will attach output in RUN_REPORT.md |

## Notes
- Need to rerun `python scripts/run_ci_checks.py --ci` on a clean workspace (stash applied) to get green before PR creation and capture evidence. No other tests planned (docs-only scope).
