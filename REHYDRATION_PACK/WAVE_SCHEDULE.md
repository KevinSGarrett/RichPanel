# Wave Schedule (Quick)

This is the **quick view** of the wave plan.

For full details (goals + “done looks like” for every wave), see:
- `WAVE_SCHEDULE_FULL.md`

Current repo mode (controls whether Cursor artifacts are required):
- `MODE.yaml`

Wave naming:
- **Fxx** = Foundation (documentation OS)
- **Bxx** = Build (implementation)
- **Cxx** = Improvement (continuous optimization)

Legacy “Wave 00–10” mapping:
- `docs/00_Project_Admin/Wave_Naming_and_Mapping.md`

**Important (foundation vs build)**
- Phase **F** is the deliverable for *file/folder structure + documentation*.
- Phase **B** (including **B00**) is a future plan for *implementation* and is **not required** to complete documentation.

## Phase F — Foundation (mode: foundation)

- **F00** Initial skeleton + baseline navigation ✅ Done
- **F01** Foundation rules + mode separation ✅ Done
- **F02** Docs indexing + navigation hardening ✅ Done
- **F03** Rehydration pack automation hardening ✅ Done
- **F04** Reference indexing + plan normalization ✅ Done
- **F05** Policy + template hardening + living docs set ✅ Done
- **F06** Foundation readiness + plan→checklist extraction ✅ Done
- **F07** Doc hygiene cleanup ✅ Done
- **F08** Registry sync + schedule clarity ✅ Done
- **F09** Foundation DoD + schedule mapping ✅ Done
- **F10** Build-mode readiness (PM prompts + run scaffolding + GitHub ops policy) ✅ Done
- **F11** Multi-agent GitHub Ops hardening (branch budget + protected delete guard + CI entrypoint + git run plan) ✅ Done
- **F12** GitHub defaults locked + branch protection settings ✅ Done

## Phase B — Build (mode: build)

Build waves begin only when you switch:
- `REHYDRATION_PACK/MODE.yaml` → `mode: build`

First build wave:
- **B00** Build kickoff (first run set with A/B/C, run artifacts enforced)

(Phase B is optional and begins only when you decide to start implementation.)
