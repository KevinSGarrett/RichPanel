# REHYDRATION_PACK operational mode
# - foundation: we are still building the documentation OS + repo structure
# - build: Cursor agents run and produce RUN artifacts

mode: foundation
current_wave: WAVE_F12

notes: |
  Foundation mode: focus is repo structure, documentation architecture, indexing,
  chunking standards, policy/template hardening, and build-readiness criteria.
  No Cursor run outputs are required in this phase.

  Clarifier: Build wave B00 is not required to complete Foundation (documentation OS).
  It is only used when implementation begins.

transition_to_build_mode: |
  1) Complete `docs/00_Project_Admin/Build_Mode_Activation_Checklist.md`
  2) Update this file:
     - set `mode: build`
     - set `current_wave: WAVE_B00`
  3) Create a run folder skeleton:
     - `python scripts/new_run_folder.py --now`
  4) Populate `REHYDRATION_PACK/06_AGENT_ASSIGNMENTS.md` with the first run set prompts
  5) In build mode, validate strictly:
     - `python scripts/verify_rehydration_pack.py --strict`
