# Admin Console Guide (Planned)

Last verified: 2025-12-29 — Wave F05.

The admin console is planned (Next.js + TypeScript), but not yet implemented.

This guide will eventually cover:
- viewing runs, events, and routing decisions
- kill switch / safe mode controls (ops-only)
- viewing model/version configuration
- viewing eval/quality metrics
