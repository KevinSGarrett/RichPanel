# Structure report — Wave 10 Update 1

Date: 2025-12-22

## Summary
- Started **Wave 10 — Operations / Runbooks / Incident Response / Training**.
- Added `docs/10_Operations_Runbooks_Training/` with:
  - operations handbook
  - runbook index + initial runbook set (R001–R010)
  - on-call and escalation policy
  - training materials (agent overrides + feedback)
  - incident comms + postmortem templates
  - Wave 10 DoD checklist
- Aligned folder numbering with the wave schedule:
  - governance: `docs/10_Governance_Continuous_Improvement/` → `docs/11_Governance_Continuous_Improvement/`
  - cursor packs: `docs/11_Cursor_Agent_Work_Packages/` → `docs/12_Cursor_Agent_Work_Packages/`
  - stub `MOVED.md` files exist at old paths.

## Navigation updates
- Updated:
  - `docs/INDEX.md`
  - `docs/CODEMAP.md`
  - `docs/ROADMAP.md`
  - regenerated `docs/REGISTRY.md`

## Notes
- No implementation changes are included (documentation only).
- Runbooks intentionally reference Wave 06/07/08/09 artifacts rather than duplicating them.
