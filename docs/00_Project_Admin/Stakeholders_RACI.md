# Stakeholders & RACI

Last updated: 2025-12-22

This is a pragmatic v1 RACI for the project plan.  
Replace role labels with actual names once your org confirms ownership.

## Stakeholders (roles)
- **Project sponsor / business owner:** Leadership Team
- **Product owner:** Support Ops + Leadership (shared)
- **Engineering owner:** You (developer)
- **Support operations owner:** Support Ops
- **Security/Compliance owner:** You (developer) + Leadership (consulted)
- **Data/Evals owner:** Engineering (you) + Support Ops (labeling)
