## High-impact changes

   - Reduces ambiguity for Support Ops and Engineering.

2) **Governance Audit Checklist**
   - Converts governance from “documentation” into repeatable checks with evidence.
   - Adds weekly/monthly/quarterly cadence for drift, change control, security hygiene.

3) **Wave 11 completed**
   - Trackers and roadmap now reflect governance as done; Wave 12 is next.
