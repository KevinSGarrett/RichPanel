## What changed behaviorally
- Governance is now explicitly defined as:
  - versioned artifacts + change gates
  - recurring triage/calibration cycles
  - traceable decisions and rollbacks

## Cross-wave connections
- Wave 04: golden set + multi-intent rules inform calibration and regression gates.
- Wave 05: templates/macros are governed as customer-facing release artifacts.
- Wave 08: drift signals and dashboards are inputs to weekly/monthly ceremonies.
- Wave 09: smoke packs and go/no-go gates are required release gates.
- Wave 10: incidents and runbooks feed back into the improvement loop.
