# To-Do System (Project Checklist)

Last verified: 2025-12-29 — Wave F06.

This folder stores the canonical checklist(s) derived from the project plan.
It is designed for AI agents to update continuously without producing unbounded token growth.

## Files (human-facing)

- `MASTER_CHECKLIST.md` — high-level epics/milestones (keep short)
- `PLAN_CHECKLIST.md` — explains the traceable plan checklist workflow + links to generated outputs
- `BACKLOG.md` — unprioritized items and ideas
- `DONE_LOG.md` — append-only record of major completed items (with dates/links)

---

## Generated outputs (do not hand-edit)

Generated by:
- `python scripts/regen_plan_checklist.py`

Outputs:
- `_generated/plan_checklist.json` — machine-readable checklist items
- `_generated/PLAN_CHECKLIST_EXTRACTED.md` — full extracted list (grouped by doc/heading)
- `_generated/PLAN_CHECKLIST_SUMMARY.md` — counts by docs section

---

## Rules

- Keep checklist items atomic in the source docs.
- Update statuses at the source (plan docs), then regenerate compiled outputs.
- If an item is completed, attach evidence:
  - `docs/08_Testing_Quality/Test_Evidence_Log.md`
  - `qa/test_evidence/`
