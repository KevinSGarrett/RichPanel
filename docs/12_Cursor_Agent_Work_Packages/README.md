# Cursor Agent Work Packages (Wave 12)

Last updated: 2025-12-23 (Update 2)

This folder contains **build-ready execution packs** (epics → tickets → copy/paste prompts) aligned to the documentation plan.

**Important**
- These are *execution artifacts* for implementation (Cursor builders), not core planning docs.
- They must be used **together** with the plan docs under `docs/` (architecture, security, testing, etc.).
- Builders should follow the rules in **Policies.zip** (not included here) for coding style, security, and workflow.

## Start here
1. `00_Overview/Execution_Pack_Overview.md`
2. `00_Overview/Implementation_Sequence_Sprints.md`
3. `00_Overview/V1_Cutline_and_Backlog.md`
4. `00_Overview/Jira_Import_Instructions.md`
5. `03_Tickets/TICKETS_INDEX.md`
6. `04_Cursor_Run_Prompts/` (copy/paste prompts)

## Folder layout
- `00_Overview/` — how to use these packs + definitions
- `01_Work_Breakdown/` — epics, sequencing, dependency graph
- `02_Epics/` — epic-level scope + ticket lists
- `03_Tickets/` — individual tickets (acceptance criteria, tests, references)
- `04_Cursor_Run_Prompts/` — copy/paste prompts for Cursor agent runs
- `assets/` — CSV/YAML supporting artifacts (ticket list, dependency map)
