# Wave 10 — Operations runbooks, incident response, training

Last updated: 2025-12-22

Status: **Complete ✅**

## Goals
- make the system **operable** by humans (day-2 operations)
- provide **runbooks** for the most likely/impactful incidents
- define on-call and escalation paths
- train support teams on:
  - routing tags and confidence
  - overrides and feedback signals
  - high-risk workflows (chargebacks, shipping exceptions)

## Deliverables (Wave 10)
- Operations handbook:
  - `docs/10_Operations_Runbooks_Training/Operations_Handbook.md`
- Runbook index + runbooks:
  - `docs/10_Operations_Runbooks_Training/Runbook_Index.md`
  - `docs/10_Operations_Runbooks_Training/runbooks/`
- On-call and escalation policy:
  - `docs/10_Operations_Runbooks_Training/On_Call_and_Escalation.md`
- Operational cadence checklists:
  - `docs/10_Operations_Runbooks_Training/Operational_Cadence_and_Checklists.md`
- Training materials:
  - `docs/10_Operations_Runbooks_Training/Training_Guide_for_Support_Teams.md`
  - `docs/10_Operations_Runbooks_Training/training/`
- Incident templates:
  - `docs/10_Operations_Runbooks_Training/templates/`

## Status
- **In progress** (Wave 10 Update 1 delivered)

## Notes
- Wave 06 security runbooks remain authoritative for security incidents; Wave 10 links to them.
- Wave 07 tuning playbook remains authoritative for scaling decisions; Wave 10 links to it.
- Wave 08 operator quick-start is the “fast path”; Wave 10 is the full operational layer.


## Progress

### Update 2 (2025-12-22)
- Added per-runbook dashboards/metrics/log queries and smoke-test verification sections.
- Added runbook quick mapping table in Runbook Index.
- Added post-mitigation verification guidance in Operations Handbook.
- Marked Wave 10 DoD checklist complete.
