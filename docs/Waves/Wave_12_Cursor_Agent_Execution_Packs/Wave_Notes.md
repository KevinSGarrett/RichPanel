# Wave 12 — Cursor agent execution packs (ready-to-build tickets)

Last updated: 2025-12-23

## Goals
- Convert the documentation plan into **implementation-ready** execution packs (epics → tickets).
- Provide clear sequencing, dependencies, acceptance criteria, and test requirements.
- Provide copy/paste **Cursor run prompts** aligned to your workflow.
- Ensure deferred Richpanel tenant verification items are captured as build tasks without blocking early development.

## Deliverables
- Execution pack overview + ticket template
- Work breakdown structure + dependency graph
- Epic sheets (scope + ticket list)
- Ticket set with acceptance criteria + test gates
- Cursor run prompts and output requirements
- Machine-readable ticket list (CSV)

## Status
- Complete ✅ (Update 2)

## Notes
- These packs are optional planning artifacts, but they reduce build ambiguity and re-interpretation.
- The plan remains the source of truth (`docs/`). If implementation requires deviations, update docs and record decisions.
