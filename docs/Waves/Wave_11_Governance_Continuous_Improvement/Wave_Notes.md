# Wave 11 — Governance, drift management, iteration loop

Last updated: 2025-12-22

## Goals
- Establish a **sustainable governance system** for routing + FAQ automation.
- Prevent untracked production changes to prompts, templates, thresholds, and mappings.
- Define how we detect drift, calibrate, and continuously improve quality safely.
- Make ownership and operating cadence explicit so this system remains maintainable.

## Deliverables
- Governance program overview + scope
- Ownership and RACI
- Governance cadence + meeting templates
- Change management process (standard + emergency)
- Model update policy
- Taxonomy drift detection + calibration process
- Versioning rules for prompts/templates/schemas
- Procedures for adding intents/teams/templates
- Continuous improvement loop
- Governance Quick Start (operator-friendly guide)
- Governance Audit Checklist (weekly/monthly/quarterly)

## Status
- **Complete ✅** (Wave 11 Update 2 closeout)

- Wave 08 (observability + drift detection + reporting)
- Wave 09 (release gates + smoke tests)
- Wave 10 (ops runbooks + training)
