Distinguishing Bot Messages to Agents:

 If you do post replies automatically, it’s good practice to let agents know it was an automated message (so they have context). Since the message will appear as coming from an “operator,” one way to do this is to create a dedicated agent account for the bot. For example, you might create an agent user named “ACME Bot” or “Auto Assistant”. Then generate your API key under that user (or have that user’s credentials used for API). That way, when a comment is posted, it will show the author as “ACME Bot” (with perhaps a bot icon if you set one). Agents will immediately see that the response was automated by the bot user. However, note that Richpanel licenses agents by seat, so using a bot account could consume a paid seat. You should clarify with Richpanel if they offer a free or discounted seat for an automation/bot user. Some platforms treat “light agent” or “bot” differently, but Richpanel doesn’t explicitly mention a bot user type in their materials. It’s likely you’ll have to use a standard agent slot for the bot identity.

If you don’t use a separate bot user, the automated reply will appear to come from whichever API key or account you used. If your API key is tied to an admin user, it might show that admin as the author of the message (which could confuse agents). Therefore, using a separate bot agent is recommended for clarity, even if it costs an extra seat. Label that user clearly as a bot in the name. As for customers, they will just see a normal reply (unless you choose to phrase it as coming from an AI). You might want to include in the message text something like “[Automated Message]” or a particular tone so the customer knows it’s an automated reply (that’s a business decision).
