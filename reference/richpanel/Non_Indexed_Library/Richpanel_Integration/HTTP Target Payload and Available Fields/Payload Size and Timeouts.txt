Payload Size and Timeouts: 

Richpanel’s documentation doesn’t specify a maximum payload size or an exact timeout for HTTP Target calls. However, it’s safe to assume the payload should be reasonably sized (likely in the order of a few kilobytes at most) – sending extremely large JSON objects (like entire transcripts) may not be advisable. As for timeouts, since these calls happen as part of an automation rule, Richpanel will have a timeout to avoid delays (commonly webhooks time out after ~5–10 seconds if not sooner). Although not explicitly stated, you should design your endpoint to respond quickly (within a few seconds). A slow endpoint could cause the automation to fail or be skipped. In absence of official numbers, we recommend keeping response times under ~3–5 seconds.
