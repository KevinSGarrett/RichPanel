Auth Headers for Security: 

Richpanel allows you to add custom HTTP headers to the outgoing request, which is how you can include authentication for your middleware service

. For example, you can set an API key header or an HMAC signature header in the HTTP Target configuration so that your server can verify the request is legitimate. (The UI provides fields to add headers when creating the HTTP Target.) This means you can secure the webhook by requiring a token – Richpanel will send that header on every call. However, request signing/HMAC isn’t generated by Richpanel beyond what you set as static headers – i.e. Richpanel doesn’t calculate dynamic signatures itself; it will only send whatever static secret or token you configure. Also, there’s no mention of IP whitelisting for Richpanel’s webhook calls, so you should rely on the auth header to authenticate the request (Richpanel’s servers likely use dynamic IPs on AWS). In summary, the HTTP Target payload is fully customizable: you’ll construct a JSON body with all the context your middleware needs, and you can include identifiers for deduplication and auth tokens for security.
