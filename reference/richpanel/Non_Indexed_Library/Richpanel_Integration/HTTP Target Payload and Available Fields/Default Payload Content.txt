Default Payload Content:

By default, when you set up an HTTP Target in Richpanel, you have the ability to define the request payload yourself. Richpanel doesn’t automatically send a fixed schema of ticket data; instead, you compose the payload (JSON, form data, or XML) and insert whatever variables you need. In other words, the default payload is essentially blank until you configure it. Richpanel provides templating with placeholders (using {{...}} syntax) to include conversation data. For example, in the screenshot above, the JSON template explicitly includes fields like the customer’s name ({{ticket.customer.name}}), email ({{ticket.customer.email}}), last order number ({{ticket.customer.lastOrderNumber}}), ticket creation time ({{ticket.createdAt}}), and even a ticket identifier URL ({{ticket.url}}). This shows that you can include key identifiers such as the conversation ID or URL, customer info, and even specific message content if there are placeholders for it. Common variables available include the customer’s name, email, phone, last order ID, ticket subject, status, etc., and you can likely include the latest message text (Richpanel’s templating would have a placeholder for the newest message or comment, though we’d confirm the exact placeholder name with their docs or support).
