Customizing the JSON Body: 

You have full control over the JSON structure that gets sent. You can choose which fields to send and what to name them. Richpanel does not restrict you to a fixed schema – you craft the request body in the HTTP Target setup. In the UI, when creating an HTTP Target, you’ll select the HTTP method (GET/POST/etc.), content type (e.g. “JSON template”), and then enter the body with placeholders for any ticket attributes you need. This means you can keep the payload minimal (e.g. just send conversation ID and latest message text), or include rich context (customer info, entire order details if available, etc.) depending on your needs. Masking PII would be your responsibility – since you decide which fields to send, you can simply choose not to include sensitive data like full customer addresses, or you could redact part of it in your middleware. Richpanel does not appear to offer an automatic PII-masking function for the webhook payload; you’ll want to only include what’s necessary to maintain privacy.
