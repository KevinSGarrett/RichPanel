Compliance (DPA, SOC2, etc.): 

Richpanel is geared towards e-commerce businesses and is cognizant of data protection regulations. They have a published Data Processing Addendum (DPA) and Privacy Policy available on their site
richpanel.com
 – you should sign the DPA with them if you handle EU customer data, to be GDPR compliant. In terms of security certifications: Richpanel lists compliance with ISO 27001 and ISO 27018 (information security and cloud privacy standards)

. They also mention HIPAA self-certification

, meaning they have internal processes to handle health data securely if needed (useful if you ever integrate health-related info, though in e-commerce that’s unlikely). They are also a Cloud Security Alliance member and have completed a CASA assessment

. While not explicitly stated, SOC 2 isn’t listed on their page, so they may not have a SOC 2 report yet (ISO is similar in rigor though). If compliance is a big factor, you can ask them for any audit reports or security whitepapers. They do have a “Security Policy” and “Subprocessor list” on their website

 for transparency.
