Routing in Live Chat: 

One special note for live chat conversations – you can route a live chat to a team as soon as it’s created (or as soon as the customer sends the first message) by using the same approach. The automation rule for “conversation created” or “new message” can trigger your middleware, which then assigns the team. This should happen before an agent picks up the chat. Richpanel will typically hold new chats unassigned (or assign based on round-robin rules if configured) until an agent accepts it. By assigning a Team quickly via API, you ensure the chat goes into the right department’s queue. It’s advisable to configure Richpanel’s chat settings so that there’s a brief window for the automation to run (e.g. don’t auto-assign to any online agent universally; use teams or wait a couple seconds). That way, the chat can be transferred to the correct team without an agent from the wrong department grabbing it. Once your middleware sets the team, Richpanel will notify only agents of that team (or follow any assignment rules defined for that team) for the incoming chat. In essence, the same team assignment logic applies to chats as to tickets.
