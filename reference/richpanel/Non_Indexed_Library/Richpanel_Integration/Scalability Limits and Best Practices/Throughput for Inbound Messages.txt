Throughput for Inbound Messages: 

You plan to process every inbound message with the middleware. If volume is, for instance, 100 messages per minute (just an example), that’s under the limit (100/min = ~1.67 per sec). But if volume spikes or if your middleware is making multiple API calls per message, you need to be careful. The “safe” throughput given the limit is roughly 100 messages per minute (if one API call per message). If each message might lead to 2 or 3 API calls, then the safe throughput is proportionally lower (e.g., ~33 messages/minute if 3 calls each, to stay around 100 calls/minute). Keep in mind, rate limit is 50 per 30 seconds, which resets every 30s window. If you overshoot in one window, you’ll get blocked until the window resets (the Retry-After header will tell you how many seconds to pause).
