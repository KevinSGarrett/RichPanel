Can the limit be raised? 

Richpanel hasn’t publicly advertised higher rate limits for higher plans. Some competitors do allow increasing limits for enterprise. It’s worth asking Richpanel directly if you foresee hitting the ceiling – they might evaluate on a case-by-case basis. However, unless you’re doing heavy operations, 50 requests/30s is usually sufficient for normal ticket flows, especially with efficient use of each request.
