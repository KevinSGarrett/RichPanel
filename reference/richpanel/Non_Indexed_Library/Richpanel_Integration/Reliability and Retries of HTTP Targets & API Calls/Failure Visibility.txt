Failure Visibility: 

Does Richpanel provide logs for HTTP Target deliveries? There’s no user-facing log dashboard mentioned for HTTP Targets. In the UI, you create the target and use it in rules, but there isn’t a known “webhook deliveries” log section. If an HTTP Target fails, you might only notice because the expected action didn’t happen (or perhaps the automation rule could have an action after the HTTP call that doesn’t execute – unclear). It would be great if Richpanel surfaced webhook errors (some systems will show an error in the rule execution log). We recommend asking Richpanel support if there is any log or record of HTTP Target calls (especially failures). They might be able to check on their side if a webhook was delivered successfully or not, but proactive logging isn’t in the docs.
