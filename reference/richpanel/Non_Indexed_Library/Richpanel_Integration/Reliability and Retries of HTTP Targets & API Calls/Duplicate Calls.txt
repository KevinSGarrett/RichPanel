If Richpanel does implement a retry on failure, you could get the same payload multiple times (in an at-least-once scenario). It’s wise to build idempotency into your middleware regardless. Use the conversation_id and perhaps a message timestamp to detect if you’ve already handled this event. That way, even if Richpanel were to send it twice (e.g. network issue on acknowledging the first attempt), your system won’t double-post a reply. But again, the likely scenario is at-most-once (no retry), which means you trade the risk of missing a message vs. duplicate handling. Given that, you might want to log all incoming webhook calls and have alerting if one fails, so you can manually intervene if needed (since Richpanel doesn’t appear to queue and retry for an extended period).
