Timeouts and Success Codes: 

Although not specified, typically Richpanel will consider any HTTP 2xx response as a success for the HTTP Target call. If your endpoint returns a 200 OK (or 204, etc.), Richpanel will treat the automation action as completed. If you return a 4xx or 5xx status, Richpanel will consider it a failure. We don’t have the exact timeout value, but many webhook systems use ~5 seconds. If your service doesn’t respond within that time, Richpanel might cut off the request (and possibly mark the automation action as failed). They haven’t published a “retry 3 times” or anything, so assume no built-in retries on failure. Therefore, design your endpoint to respond quickly (acknowledge the request and process asynchronously if needed) so that you rarely hit the timeout.
