Summary:

leverage the sandbox environment for initial development and realistic testing (Richpanel is willing to set one up

). Use test tickets in prod for final sanity checks. Have separate API keys and toggle rules gradually. This approach will let you validate everything without jeopardizing the real operation, ensuring a smooth rollout of your middleware integration.
