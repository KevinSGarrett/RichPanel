Trigger on Customer Messages Only:

 The first step is to configure your Richpanel automation rule to only fire on inbound customer events, not on every single update. Richpanel’s rules engine allows conditions based on events and properties. You’ll want your HTTP Target rule to run when a new message from a customer is received (or when a ticket is created by a customer). Do not have it trigger on “any update” or on agent replies. In many helpdesks, there’s a condition like “if last message is from customer” or “message sender = customer”. If Richpanel’s UI offers that, use it. This ensures that when your middleware adds a reply or tag (which counts as an update), it doesn’t satisfy the trigger conditions and thus won’t re-fire the rule. Essentially, scope the automation to customer-side activity only.

For example, if the rule is “When a message is received and Channel is Email and (maybe some condition about content)… then HTTP Target,” make sure there isn’t a case where your own API-driven message could meet those conditions. If your bot’s reply could possibly trigger other rules, use conditions to prevent that (like “Message author is not bot” or similar – although “author” might not be directly exposed, using teams or tags can proxy this).
