“Non-text-only messages provide zero intent” → false positives on FAQs + unsafe automated replies
What goes wrong

A customer sends:

“📷” with only a screenshot of an order page,

a voice note saying “where is my stuff”

a video of a damaged delivery

no caption text

Your classifier sees near-empty text and may:

incorrectly match “order status” (or another FAQ) and auto-reply,

route to the wrong team,

or fail entirely.

This is a very common source of “automation feels dumb” feedback.

How to avoid it

Make your middleware explicitly non-text aware with a decision policy:

If no usable text AND there are attachments:

do not run FAQ automation

route to a dedicated queue (or a department based on channel/order linkage)

add tag needs_attachment_review

If minimal text like “help”, “??”, “see attached”:

ask a structured clarifying question (one message):

“Can you share your order number or the email used to place the order?”

OR route to a human if you want zero friction

Only use extraction (OCR/STT) when it’s worth it:

For order status, OCR might be worthwhile only if:

attachment is a screenshot-like image/PDF

size is under your threshold

you can do it quickly and reliably

Otherwise, avoid adding fragile steps that slow everything down.

Security/privacy guardrails (must-have):

treat all attachments as untrusted input

don’t send raw attachments into the LLM by default

log minimal metadata (avoid storing PII-heavy images in plain logs)
