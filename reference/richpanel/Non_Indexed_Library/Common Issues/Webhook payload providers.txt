Webhook payload doesn’t include the identifiers you need (so everything becomes ambiguous)

What goes wrong

Your automation rule triggers the HTTP Target, but you only send the message text.

Now you don’t reliably know:

which conversation/ticket it belongs to,

which customer it belongs to,

which channel it came from,

whether you already processed it (idempotency).

Result: extra API calls, ambiguous lookups (multiple tickets per email), and higher misrouting risk.

How to avoid it

Treat your HTTP Target body as a contract (version it like schema_version: 1).

Include at minimum:

conversation_id (ticket ID) and (if available) conversation_number

customer_id and/or customer email/phone

message timestamp (and message text)

channel identifier (email/chat/sms/etc.)

any tags/status/team currently set (so you can short-circuit work)

Generate a stable idempotency key in middleware (e.g., conversation_id + message_created_at) and store it.

This avoids a lot of downstream complexity (and reduces rate-limit pressure) because you don’t have to “re-discover” context later.
