Hitting Richpanel (or OpenAI / Shopify) rate limits during traffic spikes

What goes wrong

A busy hour = bursts of tickets.

Your middleware makes multiple API calls per message.

Richpanel’s API is rate-limited to 50 requests per 30 seconds and returns 429 with headers like Retry-After, X-RateLimit-Remaining, etc.

Result: intermittent failures, delayed routing, missing tags, and slow responses.

How to avoid it

Reduce calls per ticket:

Put the needed context into the HTTP Target payload so you don’t have to fetch the ticket again.

Prefer one update over multiple updates when possible (e.g., set team + tags + status in one operation).

Implement global rate limiting + backoff:

A token bucket limiter on your side.

On 429, honor Retry-After and retry with jitter.

Queue the “write operations” to Richpanel separately so your system remains stable during bursts.

Cache stable metadata (team IDs, tag IDs, etc.) rather than re-fetching constantly.
