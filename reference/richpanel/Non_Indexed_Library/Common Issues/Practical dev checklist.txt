A practical dev checklist to prevent most of these at once

Shadow mode first: run classification + confidence scoring, but don’t act; just log.

Hard kill switch: environment flag that disables all auto-replies instantly.

Idempotency everywhere: store processed message keys + tags.

Queue-based architecture: webhook handler only validates + enqueues.

Metrics: automation rate, false-positive rate, fallback rate, 429 rate, median end-to-end latency.

Replay tooling: ability to replay a stored event through the pipeline for debugging.
