Team/department mapping drift (your router sends tickets to the wrong place over time)

What goes wrong

Your model outputs “Billing”, but in Richpanel the team is renamed to “Payments”.

Team IDs change or you add/remove departments.

Hard-coded mappings become wrong silently.

How to avoid it

Fetch teams from Richpanel (and their IDs) via the Teams API and validate mappings at startup. 
Richpanel

Store your mapping in configuration (DB/config service), not in code.

Add a “fallback team” (e.g., General Support) if the mapping is missing.

Add an alert when:

the model selects an unmapped label,

or assignment fails with a 4xx.
