“We accidentally inline the attachment” (base64 blobs or huge HTML) → requests blow up / 413 errors
What goes wrong

A developer tries to be helpful and passes “everything” downstream by:

embedding base64 file bytes inside JSON (to your middleware or to the LLM), or

forwarding raw email bodies that include huge HTML + inline images/signatures.

This can create:

413 Payload Too Large responses,

timeouts, memory spikes, queue bloat,

and completely unhelpful LLM classification (because the model is drowning in junk).

Richpanel explicitly calls out 413 Payload Too Large as happening when the payload is too large — commonly when attempting to upload files above the size limit.

How to avoid it

Never pass file bytes in webhook payloads or LLM prompts. Pass metadata only:

attachment id / filename / content-type / size (bytes) / URL if provided

plus the customer’s caption text (if any)

If you need the file in Richpanel, use their file upload endpoint rather than embedding bytes in other requests.

Add an explicit “max input size” gate before doing anything expensive:

reject/route-to-human if payload > X KB

store attachment externally (S3/GCS) and only keep a pointer in your internal event record
