Webhook spoofing and unauthorized calls to your middleware endpoint

What goes wrong

Your middleware endpoint is publicly reachable.

Anyone can POST a fake “new message” payload and cause:

misrouting, tag/assignment changes,

automated customer messages,

or even order-status lookups (data leakage risk).

How to avoid it

In Richpanel’s HTTP Target configuration, add a static secret header (e.g., X-Middleware-Token: <random>), and reject requests without it. Richpanel supports adding auth headers on HTTP targets. 
Headway

Require HTTPS and validate:

content-type,

payload schema,

expected fields (ticket id, customer identifier).

Put the middleware behind a gateway (Cloudflare / API Gateway / Nginx) with:

rate limiting,

IP reputation filtering,

WAF rules (basic bot mitigation).

Keep Richpanel API keys secure and scoped by environment; Richpanel API auth uses x-richpanel-key.
