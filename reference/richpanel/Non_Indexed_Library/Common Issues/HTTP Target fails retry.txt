Assuming Richpanel will “retry later” if your HTTP Target fails

What goes wrong

Your middleware endpoint is briefly down (deploy, outage, cold start) or returns a non‑200.

You assume Richpanel will retry the HTTP Target delivery.

Result: you can miss inbound messages entirely (and your automation silently “skips” work).

How to avoid it

Design your webhook handler to be durable-first:

Validate + persist the event (DB/queue) immediately.

Return 200 quickly.

Add an internal retry system:

job retries with backoff + jitter

a dead-letter queue for “stuck” messages

Add a “reconciliation/sweeper” job:

periodically query for “open/unprocessed” conversations (e.g., missing your middleware_processed tag) and re-enqueue them.

Build alerts on:

non‑200 webhook responses,

queue backlog,

dead-letter volume.

(Even if Richpanel does retry sometimes, designing as if it doesn’t makes your system much more reliable.)
