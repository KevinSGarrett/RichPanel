1) Automation loops that spam customers or endlessly re-trigger your middleware

What goes wrong

Your Richpanel automation (HTTP Target) triggers on a message.

Your middleware posts an automated reply or updates the ticket.

That action accidentally matches the same automation rule again (or another rule), causing repeated triggers and potentially an infinite loop.

How to avoid it (do these early)

In Richpanel automation rules, trigger your HTTP Target only for inbound customer messages, not outbound/operator messages.

Use a “handled-by-middleware” flag:

Add a tag like middleware_processed and ensure your rule only fires if that tag is not present.

Or set a custom field like triage_status = processed.

Use a dedicated bot/integration identity (where possible) and exclude that identity in “on agent reply” automations.

Add a “loop guard” in middleware:

If the ticket already has middleware_processed or auto_replied_order_status, do nothing.

Richpanel’s HTTP Targets are designed specifically to call external systems from workflows/automation rules, so loop-proofing around them is crucial.
