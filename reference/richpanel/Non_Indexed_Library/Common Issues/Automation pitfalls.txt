Order status automation pitfalls (wrong order, missing order, privacy leaks) + safe fallback

What goes wrong

The customer asks “what’s my order status” but:

they have multiple orders,

they used a different email,

they are not authenticated,

Shopify/OMS is down,

or your lookup matches the wrong customer.

Worst case: you reveal someone else’s order info.

How to avoid it

Make “order status” automation data-driven and conservative:

If you can’t confidently match a single order, don’t guess.

Use identity checks:

Require an order number + email or ZIP/postcode before disclosing details (depending on your policy).

Respond with minimal necessary info:

current state (processing/shipped/delivered),

tracking link if available,

no addresses or sensitive fields.

Build clear fallbacks:

If lookup fails or ambiguous → ask for order number OR route to human with a tag order_status_failed_lookup.

Log and monitor “auto order status” outcomes:

follow-up rate (“that’s wrong”),

time-to-resolution,

agent takeovers.
