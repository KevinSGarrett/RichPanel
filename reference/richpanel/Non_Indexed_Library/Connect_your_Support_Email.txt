Connect your Support Email
Use this guide to connect your support emails to Richpanel.

💡
Support emails are different from user email IDs. Support emails are addresses like support@company.com or sales@company.com, which are shared by a group of users.
Benefits
If you have a shared email (like support@company.com or info@company.com), it’s recommended to use a ticketing system like Richpanel to keep track of all messages and ensure nothing falls through the cracks.

Clear accountability: Each email can be assigned to a particular user so the team has visibility.
Continue conversation with context: If a user needs to pick up a conversation that started with a team member, the entire conversation history is in one place.
Get actionable analytics: You’ll be able to measure response times, time to resolve, and customer satisfaction. You can break down these reports by team or individual.
To get started, head over to Settings → Channels → Email and click “Add new.” Select your email provider below for detailed instructions.
