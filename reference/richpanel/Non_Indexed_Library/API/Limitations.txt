Limitations
The Richpanel API is rate-limited meaning that the number of requests you can make in a period of time is limited. You can perform up to 50 requests per 30 seconds.
Once you exceeded this quota, your request will fail and the API will respond with a 429 Too Many Requests HTTP code.

All responses returned by the API contains rate-limiting headers to enable you to handle this scenario programmatically and retry when you know that your request will succeed:

HTTP Response Header

Description

X-RateLimit-Limit

It contains the max limit of requests you can make in the current period.
E.g: 50. In this case, the limit is 50.

X-RateLimit-Remaining

It contains the remaining limit of requests you can make in the current period.
E.g: 30. In this case, you can call API another 30 times in the current window.

Retry-After

It contains how many seconds you need to wait before you can retry the request.
E.g: 5. In this case, you need to wait 5 seconds.

If the rate limit is exceeded, the API responds with an HTTP 429 Too Many Requests response code and a body that details the reason for the rate limiter kicking in. The response has a Retry-After header that tells you for how many seconds to wait before retrying. You should anticipate this in your API client for the smoothest possible experience.
