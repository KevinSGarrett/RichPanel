Migrating From Other Helpdesks
If you're using Zendesk, Kustomer, HelpScout, or Gorgias, please refer to our guide "Importing Your Data." 
For unsupported platforms like Reamaze or eDesk, this guide will walk you through setting up Richpanel to manage future communications, though direct migration of historical data is not available.

Step 1: Integrate Channels in Richpanel
Begin by integrating all your customer-facing channels (email, chat, etc.) into Richpanel.

Ensure that all new customer communications are routed directly into Richpanel.
Set up forwarding rules for email and update chat widgets to point to Richpanel.

Step 2: Set a Cut-off Date
Choose a cut-off date for the migration :

After this date, all new tickets will be handled in Richpanel.
Any existing tickets in the existing helpdesk will remain there to be resolved.
Step 3: Automate Tagging of Conversations in your Old Helpdesk
To ensure that agents can easily distinguish between tickets handled in Richpanel and those that remain in old Helpdesk, you can set up an automation rule.

Tag all incoming tickets with "Reply in Richpanel." Here's how you can create the rule:

Steps to Set Up Automation Rule in edesk (For reference):
Navigate to the Settings menu in eDesk.
Select “Tags”

Create a New Tag  with name “Reply in Richpanel”
Save the created tag

Then Select Automation Rules in Settings.
Click Create New Rule.

Set up the conditions to automatically tag new conversations. Here’s an example of the rule configuration:
Condition: When a new conversation is created (trigger).
Action: Automatically add the tag "Reply in Richpanel" to the conversation.
Optional Action: Send a notification or alert to agents reminding them to reply only in Richpanel.

Rule Example:

If: A new conversation is received.
Then: Tag the conversation with "Reply in Richpanel."
This rule will ensure that every incoming ticket in your old Helpdesk after your cut-off date is automatically tagged with "Reply in Richpanel," making it easy for your team to identify and manage tickets that need attention in Richpanel.

Step 4: Migrate Agents
Once your automation rule is set, begin migrating agents to Richpanel:

Move most agents to handle new tickets in Richpanel, leaving only 1-2 agents in old Helpdesk to resolve any existing tickets.
Agents in Richpanel will handle any new tickets tagged with "Reply in Richpanel."
Step 5: Resolve Pending Tickets in Old Helpdesk
The remaining agents should focus on resolving all pending tickets.
They should not touch any tickets tagged as "Reply in Richpanel" since those are being handled in Richpanel.
Step 6: Close Resolved Tickets
After tickets are resolved in old Helpdesk ensure that any corresponding tickets in Richpanel are marked as closed to maintain consistency.
