Changing Status: 

To close or reopen a ticket via API, include the status field. Richpanel allows "status": "CLOSED" or "status": "OPEN" in the ticket update payload. For example, to close a conversation:

{
  "ticket": {
    "status": "CLOSED"
  }
}


This would mark the conversation as resolved/closed, the same as an agent closing it. Conversely, setting it to "OPEN" could reopen it (or just leave it open). Typically, you might close a ticket via middleware if, say, your external system resolved the issue (for example, a refund was completed and you want to automatically close the ticket with a note).
