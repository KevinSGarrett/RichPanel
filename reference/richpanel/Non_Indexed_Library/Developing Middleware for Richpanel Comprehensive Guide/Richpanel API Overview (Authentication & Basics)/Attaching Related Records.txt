Attaching Related Records:

Richpanel allows linking a ticket to other objects like orders. If your middleware has just performed an action on an order or you have order info from an external system, you can use the Attach Order endpoint to link an order to the conversation. This is a separate API call: PUT /v1/tickets/{ticketId}/attach-order/{appClientId}/{orderId}. Here, orderId is typically the external order number or ID, and appClientId is an identifier for the source integration (for example, Richpanel uses different app client IDs for Shopify, Magento, etc., to know where to fetch/display order details). In a custom integration, the appClientId might correspond to the API key or a designated ID for your store. By attaching an order, the Richpanel agent UI will show that order’s details in the ticket sidebar – extremely useful for agents to have context. Use this after you’ve pushed the order data into Richpanel (see next section).
