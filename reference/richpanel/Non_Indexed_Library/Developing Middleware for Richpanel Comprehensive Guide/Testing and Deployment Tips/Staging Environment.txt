Staging Environment: 

If possible, set up a staging environment of your middleware and point a Richpanel HTTP Target to it for testing, separate from production. Richpanel doesn’t have a full sandbox mode, but you can create a separate API key for testing and even a separate “brand” or site within Richpanel if your plan allows it. Then limit the automation rule to only operate for that test brand or use a condition like “if customer email contains @test.com”.
