Error Handling in Production: 

Despite testing, things can go wrong in production (perhaps due to unforeseen data inputs or external API issues). Implement notifications for errors. For example, if the middleware encounters an exception or a critical failure processing an event, have it send an email or message to your engineering team with details. This way, you can react quickly – maybe even manually intervene in a ticket if needed.
