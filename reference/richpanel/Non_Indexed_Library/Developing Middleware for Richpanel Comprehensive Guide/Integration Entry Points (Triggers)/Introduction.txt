Integration Entry Points (Triggers) - Introduction:

Richpanel allows you to call external services from the helpdesk via HTTP Targets. An HTTP Target is essentially a webhook that you configure in Richpanel. You can set these up under Settings → Integrations → HTTP Targets in your Richpanel admin. Once configured, you can use Automation Rules to trigger an HTTP Target when certain conditions are met. The most common use-case is to notify your middleware whenever a new customer message arrives. For example, you can create a rule: “If a customer sends a message (in any channel), then call the HTTP Target endpoint.” This turns Richpanel into the source of events for your middleware – on each inbound message, Richpanel will send an HTTP POST (or GET, etc., as configured) to your middleware’s endpoint.
