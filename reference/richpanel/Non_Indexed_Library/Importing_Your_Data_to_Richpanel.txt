Importing Your Data to Richpanel
Richpanel offers direct importers for the following platforms:

Gorgias
Zendesk
Kustomer
Helpscout
If you are using any of these platforms, follow the steps below to seamlessly import your helpdesk data into Richpanel.

Step 1: Set a Cut-off Date
Before you begin, it's crucial to set a cut-off date. For instance, if you plan to use your Helpdesk Platform until December 31st, your cut-off date will be January 1st. Here's what you need to do:

Keep Zendesk (or the respective platform) operational and live-sync active until December 31st.
On January 1st, disable the live sync in your old platform so that new tickets will flow into Richpanel from this date onward.
This ensures that future tickets will be handled in Richpanel, while your historical data will still be preserved in your old helpdesk.

Step 2: Access the Helpdesk Importer
To begin the import process, navigate to Settings in Richpanel, and click on Helpdesk Importer under the Installation tab.

Step 4: Add Your Subdomain and API Key
You’ll need to provide specific information to enable the connection between Richpanel and your helpdesk platform:

Subdomain: The URL you use to log into Gorgias (or your respective platform).
Login Email: The email address you use to log in to your platform (must be an admin).
API Key: Generate an API token in Gorgias (or the relevant platform) using the steps below.

Step 6: Final Sync and Data Validation
Once you’ve configured the import settings, initiate the import by clicking Start Import. The system will begin importing your data into Richpanel.

Final Sync: On your cut-off date (e.g., January 1st), disable live sync in your old helpdesk platform. Ensure all future tickets flow into Richpanel.
Data Validation: After the import is complete, review the data to ensure everything has transferred correctly. Confirm that:
Customer information is correct.
Ticket statuses (open, pending, resolved) are accurate.
Macros, tags, and teams have been imported successfully.
