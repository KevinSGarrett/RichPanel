Thanks for reaching out—and I’m really sorry to hear this has been such a bumpy experience so far. Let’s get this sorted quickly. The yellow flashing light typically indicates a “Low Oil Alert,” which means the diffuser senses the oil level is at or below 20%. But just to be sure, I have a couple of quick questions:
Did you use one of the 20ml sample bottles from your order?

How full is the bottle right now—is it close to empty or more than half full?

If you can also send a quick photo or video of the bottle inside the diffuser, that will help us rule out a sensor issue or anything unusual with the bottle fit.

"PRODUCT INQUIRY: Oil Stain on Wood","","Hi %First Name%

Thank you for reaching Scentiment Customer Support. I'm %Agent First Name%, and I would be glad to assist you today.

I'm truly sorry to hear about the oil stains caused by our scent diffusers. Removing oil stains from wood furniture can indeed be a bit challenging, but there are some friendly and effective workarounds you can try, most of which require ingredients commonly found in your kitchen:

1. Paper Towel Blotting:
If the oil stain is fresh, gently blot it with paper towels to absorb as much oil as possible. Avoid rubbing, as it might spread the stain further.

2. Baking Soda or Cornstarch:
Sprinkle either baking soda or cornstarch onto the stain, allowing it to sit for several hours or overnight. These powders can help soak up the oil. Afterwards, simply brush or vacuum away the powder.

3. Dishwashing Detergent:
Create a mild soapy solution by mixing a few drops of dishwashing detergent with water. Dampen a cloth with this solution and delicately blot the stain. Rinse the area with a clean, damp cloth and pat it dry.

4. Vinegar and Water:
Blend equal parts of white vinegar and water to create a vinegar-water mixture. Dampen a cloth with this solution and gently blot the stain. Finish by rinsing with a clean, damp cloth and patting it dry.

I hope one of these methods proves helpful in addressing the oil stains on your wood furniture. If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out. We genuinely value your satisfaction and are here to help.

"TROUBLESHOOTING: Flashing Yellow Light: Step 2","","Hi %First Name%,

Thanks for sending the photo. I really appreciate it!

Just to give you a little context, the 20ml fragrance scent oils you have received is designed to help you explore our range of scents before committing to a full-sized oil bottle. That’s why our kits - whether starter or discovery, includes 20ml sample bottles. They’re perfect for testing out different scents, but they do hold less oil than our standard 50ml or 120ml sizes.

Since the diffuser is built to detect oil levels automatically, smaller bottles like these can sometimes trigger the “Low Oil Alert” (flashing yellow light) sooner than expected — especially if the bottle isn’t at least half full or if it’s slightly off-center inside the chamber. I recommend filling up the bottle inside your diffuser and if the flashing light won't stop, we'd be happy to proceed with a replacement. Just send a quick video showing the flashing light after filling in the diffuser bottle.

"TUTORIALS: HVAC Hookup Guide","","Hello %First Name%,
Thank you for reaching out! I am happy to help with some instructions on how to hook up your Scentiment diffuser to your HVAC system.

I've included a diagram attached to this email, however, you can also review the written instructions below for additional installation instructions.
(1) Insert the thick transparent tubing that comes with your Diffuser into the external HVAC connector.
(2) Use a screwdriver to make a small hole in the ductwork.
(3) Measure the tubing from the unit to the ductwork, and cut off the excess with a scissor.
(4) The tubing should form a 90° angle to enter the ductwork. Ensure the tubing is straight with no loops or curves.
(5) Seal the tubing with HVAC tape.

Please note - No more than an inch of transparent tubing should be inserted into the ductwork.
Ensure the tubing is placed in the supply of the duct work for an even distribution of scent (after the return and filter).
To remove this tubing, simply press and hold the black ring on the HVAC connector and carefully pull the tube out.

"TUTORIALS: Set up - Mini Scent Diffuser: Setting Up Mini Diffuser - Step by step & video","","Hello %First Name%,
Thank you for reaching out! I am happy to help get your Scent Diffuser Mini set up! You can watch the detailed video here or follow the step-by-step procedure below. 
Step 1: Touch Screen Display
You'll use the display screen to control the mist timer settings and device timer settings.
By default, the Mini works continuously for 4 hours and then turns off automatically. However, you have the flexibility to shut it off after a shorter amount of time between 1 to 3 hours. It offers three timer options to control the mist frequency. First one being 120 seconds of misting following a 60-second pause, the 2nd being the 60-second misting, followed by a 2-minute pause. Lastly, a 15-second misting, followed by a 2 and a half minute pause.

Step 2: Removing the Bottle
In order to pour your fragrance, you must first access the fragrance bottle inside the Mini. In order to do so, you’re going to reach under the bottom of the diffuser and find an opening where you’re able to push up the bottom of the bottle until the motor lid pops up. Pull the lid up away from the diffuser and unscrew the bottle from it.
Step 3: Filling the Bottle
Unscrew the empty oil bottle and fill it with the desired Scentiment fragrance oil.
Ensure that the filled bottle is securely and correctly installed back in to the nozzle.

Step 4: Reinstalling the Nozzle
It’s very important to align the arrow indicators on the nozzle and the diffuser together before pushing it back, otherwise you won’t be able to open it again and may cause damage to the device.

Thank you for reaching out! We completely understand how important this is to you, and we want to ensure you have all the details regarding your chargeback for %Order Name%.

Since a chargeback has been submitted, your bank has taken over the review process. These investigations typically take 75 to 120 business days, as your bank carefully evaluates the case before making a final decision.

However, if you’re open to canceling the chargeback, we can certainly step in and explore solutions together—whether that means a refund, store credit, or replacement.

We strongly advise considering shipping protection for your purchase. This protection allows us to replace your order or issue a refund in the form of store credit, minus the shipping cost, in case of any shipping-related problems as mentioned above.

"TROUBLESHOOTING: Diffuser Air 2 - No Mist","","Hi %Customer Name% ,

Thanks for reaching out! We know it’s frustrating when your diffuser isn’t working, and we’re here to help get it back to normal as quickly as possible. Rest assured, we’ll make sure it’s working properly for you.
To start, could you kindly check a couple of things:
Check for airflow: Please confirm if you can feel any airflow coming out of the misting hole when the diffuser is in operation. Gently lift the diffusion head, locate the small hole, and place your finger over it to check for air pressure. If you do not feel any air pressure, please let us know so we can arrange a replacement motor pump for you.

If you do feel air pressure: Try poking the misting hole with the provided pipe. Insert it into the misting hole at the top of the diffuser head. This helps release the anti-leak ball inside, which can sometimes get stuck and block airflow. See Attached photo below as a reference.

For additional guidance, here’s a video showing how to troubleshoot your Scentiment Air 2, including how to check airflow and poke the misting hole.: YouTube Guide.
No Mist: 1:00

Diffuser No Airflow: 4:00

Please try these steps and let us know the results. We’ll be here to assist further if the issue continues.
Thank you again for reaching out – we appreciate your patience and understanding.

Battery Life & Auto Shut-Off: The diffuser is designed to automatically turn off after 8 hours of total runtime. Depending on your misting level, the battery lasts 12–30 hours.

"TROUBLESHOOTING: Mini Diffuser 2 LE – Not Turning On","","Hi %Customer Name%,

Thanks for reaching out! We understand how frustrating it can be when your diffuser won’t turn on, and we’re here to help get this sorted out as quickly as possible.
To get started, please try the steps below:
Check Charging & Power: Make sure you’re using the USB-C charging cable that came with your Mini Diffuser 2 LE. Plug the diffuser into a working power source and let it charge for up to 4 hours. While charging, you should see a soft pulsing green light on the front of the diffuser.

If the light is still pulsing after 4 hours, please let us know so we can help further.
Inspect the Power Button: Check the top surface of the diffuser for any oil, dust, or residue that may interfere with the touch-sensitive power button. Gently wipe the surface clean, then try turning the diffuser on again.

LED On but No Mist or Airflow: If the diffuser powers on and the LED lights up but there’s still no mist or airflow, this may be related to a no-mist issue. In that case, please follow the no-mist troubleshooting steps below.
