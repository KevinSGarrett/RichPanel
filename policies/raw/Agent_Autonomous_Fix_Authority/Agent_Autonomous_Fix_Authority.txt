[Agent Autonomous Fix Authority]

AUTONOMOUS FIX AUTHORITY (CURSOR AGENTS)

Objective:
Reduce PM bottlenecks by allowing agents to self-diagnose and fix problems they discover while building/testing, without waiting for instructions.

Default behavior (no waiting):
- If you encounter an error, failing test, broken build, flaky behavior, or mismatch vs expected behavior, immediately enter a Fix Cycle and attempt resolution autonomously.
- Choose the smallest correct fix that restores expected behavior and keeps quality gates green.

Fix Cycle (required):
1) Reproduce: capture the exact failure (error text, failing test name, repro steps).
2) Scope: identify the touched/impacted surface area (files/modules/endpoints/workflows).
3) Diagnose: state likely root cause(s) and why.
4) Fix: implement the minimal safe change (prefer localized fixes over broad refactors).
5) Verify: run relevant tests/quality gates; do not claim “fixed” without executed proof.
6) Document: update the appropriate docs/run log if the fix changes behavior or resolves an issue.

Decision rules:
- If multiple fixes are possible, prefer:
  A) minimal blast radius
  B) preserves existing contracts
  C) adds/updates tests to prevent regression
- Do not “patch around” symptoms if a clear root cause fix is feasible.

Escalation triggers (STOP and ask PM before proceeding):
- Requirement ambiguity: the “correct behavior” is unclear and you would be guessing intent.
- Contract changes: changes that alter public APIs, event schemas, request/response shapes, DB schemas, or user-facing behavior.
- Security/compliance risk: auth, permissions, secrets, PII handling, or anything that could create a vulnerability.
- High-risk operations: data migrations, destructive deletes, irreversible actions, cost-impacting infra changes.
- Major changes: large refactor / architecture change beyond the ticket’s scope, or adding major dependencies.
- Test integrity: any “fix” that would require disabling tests, weakening assertions, or skipping validation.

If no escalation trigger applies:
Proceed autonomously through Fix Cycle and complete with proof.

End-of-work output (required):
Provide a Fix Report (template below) including test commands and results.

FIX REPORT

- Issue: <what failed + where>
- Repro: <how to reproduce / failing test name>
- Root cause: <1–3 sentences>
- Fix summary: <what changed and why it’s minimal>
- Files changed: <paths>
- Tests run (commands + results):
  - <command> → <pass/fail summary>
- Evidence/artifacts: <logs, screenshots, reports paths if relevant>
- Risk/edge cases: <what could regress + mitigation>
- Escalations: <none OR what you asked PM about>

 (ex: “API changes require updating docs + contract tests,” “DB migrations require rollback plan,” “Playwright failures require attaching report path,” etc.)
