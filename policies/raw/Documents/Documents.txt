[Documents]
1. documentation coverage gate

2. Provide proof of what was reviewed vs changed (prevent silent drift)

3. update essential documentation files every run

4. scan every document 

5. Every changed functional area has at least one doc updated or explicitly confirmed as already accurate.

7. All always-update docs were updated.

8. The docs index/registry has no dead links for any doc you referenced or created.

9. Do NOT claim docs are “up to date” without completing the scan + impact map.

10. Do NOT mass-edit timestamps or reformat docs just to show activity.

11. Do NOT claim docs are “up to date” without completing the scan + impact map.

12. At end of run, output:
    Docs Scan Summary:
   - Total docs scanned
   - List of docs updated (with 1-line reason each)
   - List of docs reviewed but unchanged (grouped by folder)

13. Changelog excerpt for always-update docs

14. Any new docs created + where they were linked

15. For every doc you update or create:
- Include “Last verified” date/time + what was verified
- Include exact references (file paths, endpoints, commands, config keys)
- Remove contradictions: if two docs conflict, resolve and note what changed
- Prefer small edits; avoid rewriting content that remains correct

16. If no doc exists for an impacted area, create one in the correct folder and link it from the index.

17. Find the corresponding docs by:
   - filename/path matching
   - searching for related keywords (module name, endpoint, service name, workflow name)
   - following internal doc links (indexes, references)

18. Identify all impacted areas from git diff + architectural dependencies.

19. Produce a “Docs Impact Map”:
   - Touched-by-this-run docs (must review + update if needed)
   - Always-update docs (must be updated every run)
   - Unchanged docs (explicitly confirm “reviewed, no changes needed”)

20. You must scan ALL files under /docs at the start of the run.

21. Full docs scan (read-only pass)
